# Chat-Box
It basically allows to act as a messsaging application where you can chat throught GUI tabs and communicate.
So first you run the server.java and simultaneously after that run the client.java file
After both the GUI tabs pop up client must send a message to server first and then server can reply 
Keep in mind as we are not using local host here so IP must vary which can be checked and replaced accordingly.
